"""
SMS service layer — the single path every outgoing SMS flows through.

``send_sms()`` is deliberately the *only* place that writes an ``SmsLog`` and
talks to a provider client, so every send (Daily / Alert / Reminder / Test) is
logged identically with its provider response, and the enable/recipient rules
are enforced in exactly one place. Tasks and views call this; they never touch a
provider client directly.

SECURITY: provider credentials live only in the client (which reads them from
settings/.env). This layer never sees or logs the API key.
